        The goal of the project is to develop a platform that enables both
        amateur and professional sports communities to manage tournaments,
        leagues, and events in an easy and efficient way. The platform will
        provide a space for players to organize games, track results, and
        communicate in real-time, all while maintaining a simple and intuitive
        user experience.
